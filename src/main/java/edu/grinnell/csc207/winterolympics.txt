Once a quieter counterpart to the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympic Games have grown into a sporting powerhouse, uniting global audiences every four years. Statistics from the event’s first century reflect this rapid expansion: Athlete participation has increased more than tenfold—from more than 250 competitors in 1924 to an expected 2,900 in 2026. Only 13 of those original athletes were women, who competed in only one of the Games’ nine sports: figure skating. By contrast, the 2026 Milano Cortina Games will approach gender parity, with women participating in 12 of the 16 disciplines and comprising 47 percent of all athletes. While the 16 teams in 1924 represented only a small slice of the world, the 90 participating national teams in 2026 illustrate the Olympics’ global reach. With each new Winter Games, new sports have been added to the roster, requiring exceptional strength, speed, agility, grace, and, in many cases, courage beyond spectators’ comprehension.

The Chamonix Games were originally staged as the International Olympic Committee (IOC)-sponsored International Winter Sports Week but not sanctioned as an official Olympic Games. Well-organized and equipped with new facilities, the event was a success and led the IOC to amend its charter in 1925, establishing the Winter Games. Chamonix was thereafter recognized as the first Winter Olympics.
