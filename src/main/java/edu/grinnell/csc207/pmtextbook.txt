In order to attract developers, the Java creators gave the language a C/C++-like syntax. While we ultimately have to be mindful that C favors one programming paradigm---procedural programming---and Java favors another---object-oriented programming, we can leverage our knowledge of C syntax to quickly ramp up to Java.

In this chapter, we introduce the procedural programming elements of C programming that translate directly to Java. Recall that procedural programming is a programming paradigm where a program is composed of procedural calls, i.e., functions with side effects. Once we understand how procedural programming is realized in Java, we can better understand what object-oriented programming is and how the two styles of programming contrast and complement each other.
